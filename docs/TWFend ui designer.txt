Tailwindcss frontend UI designer

hello i am looking for a webdesigner who is versed in postcss, and tailwindcss.

I am looking for someone to update my invoice template to spruce it up. I am not great with the design or colours, fonts, etc...
I'd like you to make the invoice a bit polished up so that it looks similar to

- https://pin.it/5jlPjOH
- https://pin.it/2wcSJxr
- https://pin.it/tppYaeA

Please use our company's colour style: https://www.colourlovers.com/palette/4408425/ICELABZ

It needs to be mobile friendly, and responsive to desktop too.

Here are some major improvements I need:

- improve the button colors and softness
- update the h4 for "request change" and text area + button so that it looks nice and within the overall style of the invoice.
- Adjust the facilities and attendance table to have a border
- make the check icon centered in the table
- make the copyright section is fixed to the bottom of the invoice.
- Adjust the quote line item table so that the fonts are normalised
- adjust the client's name and the company address contact section to make it look nice and brushed up.
- improve the table layout
- improve the description which shows how long the quote is valid, the quote reference and date.
- I've also attached our logo for you to include in the invoice. Can you add this in the header and footer of the template.

Can you please submit some sample works for me to look at.

I've attached the .vue file and .postcss file of the current invoice view
I've also included the screenshot of the page that I can see.

THE Â£3000 BUDGET IS FOR THE PROJECT, PLEASE PRICE FOR THIS PARTICULAR TASK.
